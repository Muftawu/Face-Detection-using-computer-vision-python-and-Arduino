Turn on a Green LED when a face is detected else turns on a Red LED .
ABOUT THIS PROJECT
INTRO

Hello geeks. Welcome to my project. In this project, we integrate Arduino with python to make a simple automated security system. Using computer vision,we detect faces and when detected we send a signal to the Arduino to turn on a Green LED, else a Red LED is turned on and a buzzer is sounded. It's pretty simple to do and requires little knowledge from python and Arduino.

APPS

You can download the Arduino IDE from this https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

You can also download the Pycharm IDE from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Visual studio code download https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

PYTHON LIBRARIES AND MODULES

Using the pycharm IDE,Visual studio code, or any other app for compiling python, we import Serial Module which is a python library for serial communication with Arduino. We also import the face detection module as well as cv2.

The code is explained in the snippets attached. Don't worry it's easy to follow.
